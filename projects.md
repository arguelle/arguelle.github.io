Ongoing
-------

### UAS navigation in GPS denied environment
We stream motion capture data into a PX4 enabled drone for navigation.
Other forms of positioning may be used - including novel systems.

### Sensor based navigation and tracking
Sensors placed on a UAS system are used to autonomously identify and navigate
  based on the value read from the sensors.
The dynamics of the system depend on the nature of the phenomenon being sensed.
